# Getting Started
1) Download & Install 'git' on your local computer. 'https://git-scm.com/downloads'
2) Download & Install 'python' on your local computer. 'https://www.python.org/downloads/'
   I would recommend to install stable version of python 3.10.4
3) Once you're done installing with this now you can clone the repository.
   1) Open CMD (Command Prompt)
   2) Move to the desired location where you want to clone the project
   3) Type 'git clone https://github.com/SidneyCodes/CommunityDatabase.git'
   4) Now you can see the project has been cloned successfully to that directory.
4) Before working on the project we should make a virtual environment first. 
   Type 'pip install -m venv venv' 
   This command will create a virtual environment for your project. 
5) Activate the virtual environment.
   Type 'venv\Scripts\activate' for WINDOWS OS
   Type 'venv\bin\activate' for LINUX based Kernel
6) Type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
   This command will install all the active packages of python that are being used in the project into your virtual environment.
7) Now just type 'python main.py' to run the project.
